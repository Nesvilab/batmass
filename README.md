# BatMass
### Mass spectrometry data visualization tools

It was originally created to provide an extensible platform, providing basic functionality, like project management, raw mass-spectrometry data access, various GUI widgets and extension points. E.g. project system, option panels, a system for easy addition of support for new file types, actions for those files, memory management for viewers, etc.

More specifically, the original goal was to be able to visualize results of LC/MS feature-finding algorithms (a feature in this context is an isotopic cluster as it elutes from the chromatographic column over time).

### What can we offer so far

As there is no paper yet, we can not release the full source code, however, the code will be out as soon as the paper lands. The software is in early alpha stage, you are expected to expect ;) a lot of bugs and irrational behavior.

The binaries are released in the hopes that it might help you take a fresh look at the raw data from your experiments.
