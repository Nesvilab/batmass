This guide will quickly step you through the installation, creation of a project and viewing mzML/mzXML files.

## Installation
Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub](https://github.com/chhh/batmass/releases/latest).  
* [Windows installer](https://github.com/chhh/batmass/releases/download/v.0.04/batmass-windows.exe)
* [Linux installer](https://github.com/chhh/batmass/releases/download/v.0.04/batmass-linux.sh)
* [MacOS installer](https://github.com/chhh/batmass/releases/download/v.0.04/batmass-macosx.tgz)
* [Platform independent zip](https://github.com/chhh/batmass/releases/download/v.0.04/batmass.zip)
`Note:` if you select the platform independent version, you'll have to launch _BatMass_ by manually running the correct executable for your platform from `<path-where-you-extracted-the-archive>/bin/`.

## First project
Go to `Main menu -> New project`, select any project type when presented with a choice, it won't matter now. Choose an existing directory or create a new empty one for the project, all the project-related files will be created inside this directory and ***not*** _a new directory with the project name under the selected directory_.

The project should now appear in the _Project Explorer_ tab on the left. Expand the project's node and right click `LC/MS Files` node, choose `Import LC/MS Files`. You can select multiple files at once by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, you can also restrict the files that are being shown to a particular format using the drop-down menu on the bottom of the file-chooser.
