OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    The update center (UC) definition is just an XML file, which is downloaded by the client's Plugin Manager.\n\
    The address for the UC, that is installed by default to clients is at Bundle.properties:\n    umich_ms_batmass_autoupdate_update_center\nThe name is also there.\n\
    The default behavior of client's UC is controlled by additional params added to batmass.conf:\n\n    -J-Dplugin.manager.check.interval=EVERY_STARTUP \n    This forces to check for updates at app start by default. if the user changes that manually later,\n    his settings will be remembered and used afterwards.\n    \n    \
    -J-Dplugin.manager.check.new.plugins=true\n    This option forces to check for new plugin availability (not only updates to the installed plugins).\n    \
    New plugins are reported as new updates in a balloon notification in the bottom right corner,\n    making it more likely to be installed by users.
