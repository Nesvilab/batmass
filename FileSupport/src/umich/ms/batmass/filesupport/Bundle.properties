OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Files should never be copied to the project. \n\
    Instead create a proxy file type, e.g. you want to import mzXML files into a project. \
    Then you should create a proxy mime-type resolved by file extension ".desc-mzXML", create that descriptor file manually in the project's "msfiles" directory and store all the info about the original .mzXML file in that descriptor (e.g. absolute path, filesize, modification date, CRC32 - everything you might need to check file integrity later). \
    This descriptor file will also store all the associated info, e.g. paths to linked identification (.pep.xml) files, applied processing steps.
OpenIDE-Module-Name=FileSupport (BatMass)
